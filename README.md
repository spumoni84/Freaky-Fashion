Complete Freaky Fashion webpages 

## About the Project

The Freaky Fashion project is part of my first frontend-developer course. This project showcases the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout the course, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a functional and user-friendly web application for managing and displaying fashion products.

### Project Highlights

- **Product Management**: Administrators can add new products with detailed information, including images, descriptions, SKUs, prices, publishing dates, and categories.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correct SKU format and restricts image uploads to specific file types.
- **Interactive Features**: Users can view available products and mark them as favorites using a heart icon.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Product Detail Page**: A separate page focused on detailed information about each product.
- **Similar Products Carousel**: A carousel showcasing similar products to enhance user engagement.
- **Favorite Icons**: Users can mark products as favorites, which are visually indicated by heart icons.
- **Checkout Page**: A dedicated page for users to review and complete their purchases.
- **Animated Logo**: An engaging animation in the logo to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

### Personal Note

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a frontend developer. I have put in a lot of effort to ensure that it hopefully meets the requirements for a väl-godkänt (A) grade. I hope that this project demonstrates my understanding of frontend development concepts and my ability to apply them effectively.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
